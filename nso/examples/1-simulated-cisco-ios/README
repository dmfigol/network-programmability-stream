Running towards 3 emulated Cisco cisco-ios routers
----------------------------------------------

This example will show how to setup a simulated network of Cisco-ios routers
and how to manage these with NCS. NCS will talk Cisco CLI towards the routers.

NCS interfaces the devices by using Network Element Drivers, NEDs. Tail-f ships
some NEDs in $NCS_DIR/packages/neds, more or available by contacting Tail-f and
the developing section in the NCS User Guide explains how to develop NEDs for
different protocols.

NEDs are shipped in packages. Packages is a structured way of adding software
to NCS and they can contain NEDs, added User Interface components, service
applications like VPN activation etc.

The most important part of the NED is the data-model. It specifies which parts
of the device NCS can configure. In order for NCS to work with the configuration
commands you need in your scenario, the corresponding data-model must cover
those parts. It is an important first phase in any NCS deployment to make sure
that the required NEDs and corresponding data-models cover the configuration
scenarios.

In order to understand the capabilities of the cisco-ios in this example, do:
  $pyang -f tree $NCS_DIR/packages/neds/cisco-ios/src/yang/tailf-ned-cisco-ios.yang

This prints a tree-structure of the YANG data-model and represents what
you can do in this example.

The NEDs can also be used by the NCS Network Simulator, ncs-netsim, to simulate
the management interface of devices.

Preparations
------------

1) Make sure you have sourced the ncsrc file in $NCS_DIR. This sets up paths and
   environment variables in order to run NCS. So this must be done all times
   before running NCS, so it is recommended to put that in your profile.

Optional:
If you do not want to create the example files in the NCS installation
directory $NCS_DIR/examples.ncs/getting-started/using-ncs/1-simulated-cisco-ios,
for example if you are several users sharing the same installation, you can
run the example in a separate directory.

2) Create an empty directory, for example in your home directory. NCS and the
   simulator will create files and directories in this example. Make sure you
   change to this directory before continuing.


Setting up and running the simulator
-------------------------------------

The package describing the device is $NCS_DIR/packages/neds/cisco-ios. The
ncs-netsim create-network command takes three parameters: the NED package,
number of simulated devices and the name prefix.

Perform the following command:

   $ ncs-netsim create-network $NCS_DIR/packages/neds/cisco-ios 3 c

This creates the simulated network in ./netsim. The simulated network consists
of 3 devices, c0, c1, and c2 and they all speak Cisco CLI.

Start the simulator:

   $ ncs-netsim start
   DEVICE c0 OK STARTED
   DEVICE c1 OK STARTED
   DEVICE c2 OK STARTED

Run the CLI towards one of the devices

    $ ncs-netsim cli-i c1
    admin connected from 127.0.0.1 using console *

    c1> enable
    c1# show running-config
    
     class-map m
     match mpls experimental topmost 1
     match packet length max 255
     match packet length min 2
     match qos-group 1
    !
    ...
    c1# exit

This shows that the device has some initial config.
Try netsim help to list all available commands:

     $ ncs-netsim -h

Make sure to stop the simulator before starting another example.


Setting up and starting NCS
---------------------------

The next thing to do is to setup NCS populated with the above devices.
The ncs-setup command can take an existing netsim directory and create
an NCS environment ready to run towards the simulated devices.
Remember, the ncs-netsim step above created a ./netsim directory.

   $ ncs-setup --netsim-dir ./netsim --dest .

This basically performs the following:
   - create directories needed for NCS (ncs-cdb, state, logs, packages)
   - link the cisco-ios NED package into the packages directory
   - populate the NCS database with meta-data about the simulated devices:
     ip address, port, SSH host keys, authentication, and NED type.

Now, start ncs

  $ ncs

(Make sure ncs-netsim is still running from the previous steps)

Start the NCS CLI:

  $ ncs_cli -u admin

  admin@ncs> show packages
  packages package cisco-ios
  ....

  admin@ncs> show configuration devices device
  device c0 {
    address   127.0.0.1;
    port      10022;
    authgroup default;
    ssh {
        host-key ssh-rsa {
            key "...";
        }
    }
    device-type {
        cli {
            ned-id cisco-ios;
        }
    }
    state {
        admin-state unlocked;
    }
  }
  device c1 {
  ...

This shows the populated meta-data for the simulated devices. They all run
at localhost but different ports. NCS knows how to talk to them via the
ned-id.

Once logged in to the NCS CLI, you can show device status or change
the device configuration. At this point NCS isn't aware whether the
devices actually exist or what their configurations might be. So the
first step will be to connect to the devices and read up their
configurations into NCS.

    admin@ncs> request devices connect
    connect-result {
    device c0
    result true
    info (admin) Connected to c0 - 127.0.0.1:10022
}
....

    admin@ncs> request devices sync-from
    sync-result {
    device c0
    result true
}
....

View the configuration of the "c0" device using the command:

    admin@ncs> show configuration devices device c0 config

Or show a particular piece of configuration from several devices

   admin@ncs> show configuration devices device c0..2 config ios:router

In order to change the configuration enter configure mode:

   admin@ncs> configure
   Entering configuration mode private

Change or add some configuration across the devices, for example:

   admin@ncs% set devices device c0..2 config ios:router bgp 64512 neighbor \
        1.2.3.4 remote-as 2


We need to stop here, and explain how NCS applies configuration changes to
the network. At this point the changes are local to NCS, nothing has been sent
to the devices yet. Since the NCS Configuration Database, CDB, is in sync with
the network, NCS can always calculate the minimum diff to apply the changes to
the network. The command below compares the ongoing changes with the running
database:

    admin@ncs% compare running brief
     devices {
         device c0 {
             config {
                 ios:router {
                     bgp 64512 {
                         neighbor 1.2.3.4 {
    -                        remote-as 1;
    +                        remote-as 2;


    ....

The changes can be committed to the devices and the NCS CDB in one go. In the
commit command below, we pipe to details to see what is going on.

   admin@ncs% commit | details

A common misunderstanding is that you have to synchronize NCS and the devices
after any changes. This is not the case, when changes are committed they are
applied to the devices and the NCS database as one transaction. If any of
the devices fails, nothing happens, NCS will roll-back any changes made to
any of the devices and the NCS CDB will not be updated. Also as seen by the
details output, NCS stores a roll-back file for every commit so the whole
transaction can be rolled back manually.

Take a look at the rollback file:

    admin@ncs% run file show logs/rollback10006
    # Created by: admin
    # Date: 2012-11-05 10:06:02
    # Via: cli
    # Type: delta
    # Label:
    # Comment:
    # No: 10006

    devices {
        device c0 {
            config {
                ios:router {
                    bgp 64512 {
                        neighbor 1.2.3.4 {
                            remote-as 1;
                        }



Load the rollback file:
    admin@ncs% rollback 10006

Show the diff:

    admin@ncs% compare running brief
     devices {
         device c0 {
             config {
                 ios:router {
                     bgp 64512 {
                         neighbor 1.2.3.4 {
    -                        remote-as 2;
    +                        remote-as 1;
                         }
    .....

Commit the rollback:

   admin@ncs% commit


To see what is going on between NCS and the device CLI enable trace:

    admin@ncs% set devices global-settings trace raw trace-dir logs

Trace settings do only take effect for new connections so disconnect:

    admin@ncs> request devices disconnect

Make a change to for example c0:

     admin@ncs% set devices device c0 config ios:interface FastEthernet 1 ip address \
          primary address 192.168.1.1 mask 255.255.255.0

     admin@ncs% commit

     admin@ncs% exit

     admin@ncs> exit


Inspect the CLI trace:

    $less logs/ned-cisco-ios-c0.trace


All of the above can also be done in the Web UI at http://127.0.0.1:8080.

Do not forget to stop ncs and ncs-netsim before moving on:

   $ ncs-netsim stop
   DEVICE c0 STOPPED
   DEVICE c1 STOPPED
   DEVICE c2 STOPPED
   
   $ ncs --stop

If you want to restore the example to the initial configuration do:

   $ ncs-netsim reset
   $ ncs-setup --reset



The commands in summary:

ncs-netsim create-network $NCS_DIR/packages/neds/cisco-ios 3 c
ncs-netsim start
ncs-setup --netsim-dir ./netsim --dest .
ncs
ncs_cli -u admin
